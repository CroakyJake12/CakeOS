# CakeOS HUI Linux graphical preview host

This is the first graphical Linux backend slice for HUI. It is intentionally a normal unprivileged desktop process: it does not replace GNOME Shell or Mutter, install a GDM session, or call privileged OS services.

The host consumes the platform-neutral `Haven.UI` source pinned by `havenos.lock`. The initial renderer deliberately implements only the HUI draw-command subset used by this preview and throws on unsupported commands so a partial backend cannot be mistaken for full HUI compatibility.

## External application launcher contract

An application assembly provides one public, parameterless type implementing
`CakeOS.HuiLinuxHost.IHuiRootProvider`:

```csharp
using CakeOS.HuiLinuxHost;
using Haven.UI.Components;

public sealed class ApplicationRootProvider : IHuiRootProvider
{
    public Page CreateRoot() => BuildApplicationRoot();
}
```

The application assembly must reference `cakeos-hui-linux-preview` so its
provider implements the exact host interface. Launch it through the shared
host, using an absolute provider assembly path and its fully-qualified type:

```sh
cakeos-hui-linux-preview \
  --hui-root-provider-assembly /opt/haven/apps/application/Application.dll \
  --hui-root-provider-type Haven.Applications.ApplicationRootProvider
```

`HuiRootProviderResolver.Resolve` loads that type, and
`App.OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted` mounts its `CreateRoot()` result via
`new HuiPreviewSurface(root)`. Omitting both options retains the current
preview-scene launcher; specifying either option without the other is an
error. Arguments other than these two options continue to Avalonia.

The automated graphical gate must:

1. stage the exact pinned HUI source;
2. compile a Linux-x64 Avalonia host;
3. start a real window under Xvfb;
4. exercise HUI pointer and keyboard activation through `HavenInputRouter`;
5. capture the displayed window to a PNG;
6. preserve logs and screenshot as CI evidence.

Text measurement is performed through Avalonia's real `FormattedText` metrics so HUI layout receives the same wrapped text height that the Linux renderer will draw. This is part of the graphical acceptance boundary: a screenshot with overlapping wrapped text is a failed visual QA result even if the process exits successfully.

The CI screenshot is evidence that a real Linux window was rendered in the runner's virtual display; it is not evidence that the approved CakeOS VM has displayed the same window.

Passing that gate is graphical Linux-host evidence, not approved-VM visual proof. Approved-VM installation and observation remain a later acceptance gate.
