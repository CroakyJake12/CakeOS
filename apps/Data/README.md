# Haven Data — Calc + DuckDB first slice

Status: **implemented and runtime-proven on disposable Ubuntu 24.04 and Ubuntu 26.04.1 CI; not yet accepted inside the approved CakeOS VM**.

This directory is the CakeOS-native Haven Data foundation. It does not copy the legacy donor implementation or LibreOffice/DuckDB upstream source. HUI-facing code depends only on Haven-owned interfaces; LibreOffice Calc and DuckDB live behind separate worker processes.

```

No UNO type or DuckDB API is exposed to HUI. Calc remains authoritative for workbook semantics. DuckDB receives explicit snapshots. Query results return to Calc only through a typed, new-sheet, literal-value materialisation operation.

## Evidence ledger

| Claim | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Source implemented | Yes — CakeOS branch `data-calc-duckdb-first-slice` |
| .NET 10 build | Yes — Ubuntu 24.04 and Ubuntu 26.04.1 GitHub Actions with warnings treated as errors |
| HUI-facing app smoke | Yes — 10 × 8 grid, edit/recalculate/refresh, sheet selection, row/column edits, range-backed named ranges, literal-list validation, single-key sorting, literal equality filtering, database publication, bounded query history and query-result materialisation |
| Worker Python syntax | Yes — workers and integration/corpus harnesses compile with `py_compile` |
| Calc/UNO runtime | Yes — live headless Calc over a local UNO pipe opens, edits, recalculates, structurally edits, sorts, filters, manages range-backed names and literal-list validation, saves and reopens disposable ODS/XLSX workbooks |
| Formula compatibility baseline | Yes — arithmetic precedence, SUM, absolute references, exponentiation, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN and MAX |
| Row/column structural edits | Yes — live Calc insert/delete shifts formulas/references correctly, rejects unsafe/read-only edits and survives save/reopen |
| Range-backed named ranges | Yes — create/list/delete, case-insensitive duplicate/delete handling, row/column shift tracking and ODS persistence are live-proven; arbitrary named formulas are not exposed |
| Literal-list data validation | Yes — apply/read/clear, row/column shift tracking, ODS persistence, read-only guards and the full C# `DataGridSession → Calc` path are green on both distro lanes |
| Single-key sorting | Yes — bounded row sorting by one relative key column, ascending/descending numeric order, optional header preservation, invalid-key/header-only/read-only guards, ODS persistence, and the full C# `DataGridSession → Calc` path are green on both distro lanes; source run `34156898422` |
| Literal text-equality filtering | Yes — one bounded case-insensitive text `EQUAL` condition over a relative key column, header preservation, row-visibility reporting, invalid-key/header-only/empty-value/read-only guards, explicit clearing and ODS persistence are live-proven. Worker run `34158504780`; full `DataGridSession → Calc` run `34158775542` is green on both distro lanes |
| DuckDB runtime | Yes — DuckDB 1.5.5 opens disposable databases, executes bounded read-only SQL, rejects DDL/multiple statements/external access, and atomically replaces typed snapshot tables |
| Calc → DuckDB bridge | Yes — displayed-value range publication with generated/sanitised headers and structured table replacement |
| DuckDB → Calc bridge | Yes — non-truncated current-session query results materialise into a new Calc sheet as literal text; formula-looking values such as `=1+1` are not executed |
| Full .NET → workers runtime path | Yes — real C# adapters perform workbook edits, formula recalc, structural edits, named-range, validation, sort and filter operations, Calc→DuckDB publication, SQL aggregation, DuckDB→Calc materialisation, save and reopen |
| Ubuntu 26.04.1 distro proof | Yes — GitHub Actions `ubuntu-26.04`, LibreOffice `26.2.5.2-0ubuntu0.26.04.1`, Python 3.14, DuckDB 1.5.5 and .NET 10 |
| Worker protocol cancellation safety | Implemented — an in-flight cancellation or malformed/misaligned response faults and terminates the worker instead of reusing a desynchronised stream |
| Approved desktop checkout | Located — Sandbox project `cakeos` at `C:\Users\Jacob\OneDrive\Personal Files\Development\CakeOS`; its tracked/untracked Boards work is intentionally untouched by this Data branch |
| Approved CakeOS VM | **No** — the actual CakeOS VM/session has not run this branch |
| CakeOS package/image | **No** — no package list, image, ISO or VM state was changed by this branch |
| Visual HUI verification | **No** — `HUI/` still has no usable renderer contract on this branch |

The Ubuntu 26.04.1 proof materially narrows distro/runtime risk, but it is deliberately **not** labelled as approved-VM, packaged-image or visual-runtime acceptance.

## Implemented spreadsheet behaviour

- isolated headless `soffice` process and disposable LibreOffice user profile;
- local UNO pipe rather than a TCP listener;
- macro execution and document-link updates disabled at load;
- non-Calc document rejection;
- real worksheet enumeration;
- bounded range reads with per-row visibility metadata and viewport-bounded typed cell edits;
- text, number and formula editing with Calc-owned recalculation;
- row/column insertion and deletion behind typed operations;
- bounded single-key row sorting, ascending or descending, with optional header preservation;
- bounded case-insensitive literal text-equality row filtering with explicit clear;
- global named ranges backed by one concrete cell range only;
- range-backed named ranges track Calc row/column shifts and persist in ODS;
- formula-style/non-range named expressions are not surfaced through the Haven API;
- literal-list data validation behind a typed range operation;
- first-slice list rules contain 1–50 unique literal strings, each 1–64 characters, with control characters, semicolons and double quotes excluded;
- imported formula/range-driven validation is not reinterpreted as a Haven literal-list rule;
- list validation tracks Calc row/column shifts, persists in ODS and obeys read-only mutation guards;
- first-slice save-as to `.ods` or `.xlsx`, with in-place overwrite disabled;
- saved-output existence/size verification;
- worker stderr draining and bounded shutdown/kill fallback.

## HUI-facing spreadsheet session

`DataGridSession` exposes only Haven-owned records and operations:

- fixed 10 × 8 first-slice viewport;
- worksheet discovery and selection;
- edit → recalculate → refresh;
- typed row/column insertion and deletion with refresh;
- bounded single-key sort of a visible range, followed by refresh;
- bounded literal text-equality filter and explicit filter clearing, with row visibility returned in the grid snapshot;
- named-range create/list/delete; creation must fit wholly inside the current viewport in this slice;
- literal-list validation apply/read/clear; the target range must fit wholly inside the viewport;
- save-as and deterministic close/dispose semantics;
- atomic open/close failure handling.

The real HUI renderer remains a separate platform seam. No UNO/VCL object crosses this layer.

## Sort compatibility and safety boundary

- Haven exposes only one relative key column, ascending/descending order and a header flag; callers cannot supply arbitrary UNO sort descriptors;
- the target must fit wholly inside the first-slice 10 × 8 viewport when invoked through `DataGridSession`;
- sorting is a mutation and is refused for read-only workbooks;
- the Calc worker supports both LibreOffice sort descriptor forms observed in the supported distro lanes: legacy `SortColumns`/`util.SortField` and newer `IsSortColumns`/`table.TableSortField`;
- PyUNO `SortFields` is passed as an explicitly typed `uno.Any` sequence; a plain Python tuple was accepted by LibreOffice but produced a silent no-op during development;
- live tests prove ascending/descending numeric key order, header preservation, invalid key/header-only rejection and ODS save/reopen persistence on LibreOffice 24.2.7 and 26.2.5.2.

Multi-key sorting and custom collators/user lists remain separate deferred capabilities.

## Filter compatibility and safety boundary

- Haven exposes one relative key column, one literal string and a header flag; callers cannot provide arbitrary UNO filter descriptors, formulas, regex patterns or compound predicates;
- first-slice matching is case-insensitive literal text equality only, with regular-expression handling explicitly disabled;
- the target must fit wholly inside the 10 × 8 `DataGridSession` viewport and filter values are limited to 1–256 non-control characters;
- filtering and clearing are mutations and are refused for read-only workbooks;
- `DataRangeSnapshot.RowVisibility` reports Calc's row visibility without compacting or rewriting the underlying cell values, so HUI can render hidden rows deliberately;
- worker tests prove filtering does not mutate cell contents, filters survive ODS save/reopen, and an empty descriptor restores row visibility;
- the full live C# path proves `DataGridSession → CalcSpreadsheetEngine → JSON worker → UNO` filter and clear operations on LibreOffice 24.2.7 and 26.2.5.2.

Numeric comparison operators, NOT-EQUAL/range conditions, multiple criteria, regex filtering and persisted HUI filter-state metadata remain deferred.

## Literal-list validation safety boundary

- only literal list items are created by Haven Data in this slice;
- no validation formula, named range, external link or arbitrary UNO validation expression is accepted from HUI/GenUI;
- values are bounded to 1–50 unique strings of at most 64 characters;
- formula-sensitive/control characters used by the literal-list encoding are rejected;
- Calc's stored validation is re-read after apply/clear and must match the requested Haven rule;
- imported validation that is not representable as this literal subset is reported as not being a Haven literal-list rule rather than being rewritten or deleted;
- live tests prove structural row/column shifts, ODS save/reopen persistence, read-only guards and clearing.

Numeric/date/text-length/custom validation remain separate deferred capabilities.

## Database/query behaviour

- local DuckDB database;
- DuckDB 1.5.5 pinned in CI/runtime proof;
- external access, extension autoload/install, community extensions and persistent secrets disabled;
- bounded memory/thread defaults followed by locked DuckDB configuration;
- raw query text restricted to one `SELECT` or `EXPLAIN` statement;
- worker-side mutation/capability keyword rejection;
- query previews capped at 1–1000 rows;
- `DataQuerySession` tracks published tables and the 20 most recent successful queries;
- query-session close is atomic;
- raw database APIs are not exposed directly to generated UI.

## Calc → DuckDB bridge

- explicit displayed-value range snapshots rather than shared workbook authority;
- generated A/B/C… columns or sanitised first-row headers;
- source range validation;
- privileged structured `ReplaceTableAsync` rather than exposing DDL strings;
- worker-side table/shape validation;
- quoted SQL identifiers, parameterised values and transactional replacement;
- raw user/model SQL remains read-only.

Current publication is intentionally display-string based. Typed date/error/value preservation is a later compatibility milestone.

## DuckDB → Calc bridge

- only a successful query from the currently open query session can be materialised;
- truncated query previews are refused rather than silently producing incomplete sheets;
- first slice supports at most 999 data rows plus one header and 256 columns;
- result data always creates a **new** sheet; existing sheets are not overwritten;
- query output is written through Calc `setString`, so formula-looking values remain literal text;
- portable sheet-name validation and case-insensitive duplicate detection are enforced;
- ODS/XLSX save/reopen tests prove literal result values stay literal.

## Worker protocol safety

`JsonLineWorkerClient` serialises calls per worker. If cancellation occurs after a request may have been written, or stdout contains malformed JSON, EOF, a missing result or a mismatched response ID, the client faults and terminates the worker. It does not continue on a potentially shifted request/response stream.

## Runtime dependencies — not installed into CakeOS by this branch

The Calc worker expects:

- LibreOffice Calc headless runtime (`soffice`);
- Python with LibreOffice `pyuno`/`uno` bindings;
- Calc filters required for ODS/XLSX.

The DuckDB worker expects Python and the approved/pinned DuckDB runtime. The process boundary means a later move from the Python binding to the DuckDB C API does not change HUI-facing contracts.

The Ubuntu 26.04.1 CI lane proved the narrow distro packages `libreoffice-calc-nogui`, `libreoffice-core-nogui`, `libreoffice-common` and `python3-uno` are sufficient for the current integration suite. This branch does **not** install those packages into the CakeOS image or approved VM.

## Reproducible checks

```bash
dotnet build apps/Data/App/HavenOS.Data.App.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project apps/Data/Tests/HavenOS.Data.Smoke.csproj -c Release

```

`.github/workflows/data-first-slice.yml` runs all gates on Ubuntu 24.04 and Ubuntu 26.04.

## Approved-VM gate still required

1. Preserve the existing dirty Boards checkout; do not clean, stash, reset or overwrite it for Data testing.
2. When that work has been safely preserved by its owner, switch the registered CakeOS checkout to `data-calc-duckdb-first-slice` only through Sandbox's guarded branch-switch operation.
3. Confirm the approved VM identity, Ubuntu 26.04.1 environment and current package state before mutation.
4. Build first without package/image mutation.
5. If dependencies are absent, record that before any install and add them only through the approved platform/package path.
6. Run the same disposable Python and .NET integration gates.
7. Verify worker cleanup, local-pipe-only UNO communication, filesystem/network confinement, resource limits and failure/restart behaviour in the actual CakeOS session.

## HUI gate still required

Once the platform provides a real HUI renderer contract:

1. Render the `DataGridSession` 10 × 8 snapshot and honour its row-visibility metadata.
2. Exercise sheet selection, edits, row/column operations, single-key sorting, literal equality filtering, named ranges and list validation through typed commands.
3. Verify focus, selection, keyboard navigation and screen-reader semantics, including how hidden rows are announced/navigated.
4. Render query results from `DataQuerySession` without exposing raw engine objects.
5. Verify generated-UI actions map only to typed Haven operations, never unrestricted UNO/SQL authority.

## Deliberately deferred

- direct linking to LibreOffice `sc/` internals;
- embedding LibreOffice/VCL UI;
- LibreOfficeKit rendering;
- charts and drawings;
- general formatting;
- numeric/date/text-length/custom or formula/range-backed data validation;
- multi-key/custom-collation sorting;
- numeric/comparison, compound, regex and other advanced filter operations;
- arbitrary named formulas/expressions;
- raw SQL mutation/DDL;
- typed preservation beyond displayed strings in Calc↔DuckDB transfer;
- package/image changes;
- unrestricted generated-UI write operations.

## Safety notes

The worker boundary is defence in depth, not the final OS sandbox. Before shipping, Calc and DuckDB still need target-runtime confinement (AppArmor/systemd/bubblewrap or the platform-selected equivalent), explicit filesystem brokers, resource limits, crash supervision, a larger golden-file/formula corpus and visual/accessibility acceptance through HUI.
